# **Hardware-Oriented AI Accelerator Simulation on Arduino**

## **Project Description**
This project simulates a hardware-oriented **AI accelerator** using an **Arduino Nano/Uno** to optimize **matrix multiplication** with concepts like **pipelining** and **fixed-point arithmetic**. LEDs represent the different stages of computation, focusing on hardware optimizations for AI tasks rather than AI model training.

## **Key Features**
- Simulates matrix multiplication with **fixed-point arithmetic**.
- Implements a **pipelined architecture** with visual feedback via LEDs.
- Optimizes hardware tasks such as **parallelism** and **memory access**.

## **Hardware Requirements**
- **Arduino Nano/Uno**
- **4 LEDs** and **220-ohm resistors** (to represent pipeline stages)
- **Breadboard** and **jumper wires**

## **Hardware Setup**
1. Connect 4 LEDs to pins 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Arduino.
2. Use resistors to connect the LED cathodes to **GND**.
3. Connect the Arduino to your computer via **USB**.

## **How it Works**
- **Pipelined matrix multiplication** is simulated in four stages:
  1. **Load** matrix values.
  2. **Multiply** values using fixed-point arithmetic.
  3. **Accumulate** the results.
  4. **Output** the result.
- Each stage is represented by an LED lighting up.
- Results are displayed in the **Serial Monitor** in fixed-point format.

## **Example Output**:
```
Result[0][0]: 1450
Result[0][1]: 1900
Result[1][0]: 2900
Result[1][1]: 3800
```
